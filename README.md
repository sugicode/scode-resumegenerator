A CV generator (Curriculum Vitae generator) is a tool or software that helps users automatically create professional CVs or resumes. It usually provides templates, formatting, and guided input fields so users only need to fill in their personal details, work experience, skills, and education background. The system then generates a structured and polished CV in a downloadable format (PDF, DOCX, etc.).

## 👨‍💻 About CV/Resume Generator  

A CV Generator is an online tool designed to help individuals create professional and well-structured Curriculum Vitae (CV) quickly and easily. Instead of manually formatting documents, users simply input their personal information, education, work experience, skills, and achievements into a guided form.

The generator then produces a clean and organized CV using pre-designed templates that match professional standards. Some advanced CV generators also provide customization options, tips for writing strong bullet points, and even keyword optimization to pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
